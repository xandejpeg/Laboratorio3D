/**
 * Incremental draft stage — the part-by-part variant of the draft phase.
 *
 *   text → image-gen → PLAN (ordered part list) → for each part:
 *           render the build so far → generate ONE part → compile → gate → next
 *
 * Where the monolithic `runDraft` emits the entire model in a single SCAD-gen
 * call, this builder grows the model one top-level module at a time:
 *
 *   1. image-gen (identical to runDraft).
 *   2. a PLAN call decomposes the object into an ordered list of top-level
 *      parts (structural first; each attaches to something earlier).
 *   3. for each planned part, in order:
 *        a. a generation call emits ONLY that part (new params + helpers +
 *           the part module + its assembly placement), which we splice
 *           deterministically into the accumulated SCAD via marker comments;
 *        b. a compile-fix retry loop re-prompts on a broken splice;
 *        c. a delta-aware connectivity gate rejects a part that lands as a new
 *           floater, re-prompting it with the measured reason.
 *
 * A per-part focused refine used to sit after (c). It changed 64% of parts and
 * improved none of them measurably, so it was removed; the whole-model Phase 2
 * refine is the only refine.
 *
 * The accumulated SCAD carries three marker comments (PARAMS / MODULES /
 * PLACEMENTS) that the builder owns and splices against. They are re-derived
 * defensively by `ensureMarkers` and stripped from the final draft.scad.
 *
 * Outputs match runDraft so the rest of the pipeline (Phase 2 refine, resume
 * detection) is unchanged: image.png, draft.scad, draft.stl, draft.obj,
 * prompt.txt, effective_text.txt — plus plan.json and per-part artifacts under
 * `_parts/NN_<name>/`.

 * out of habit: gemini sets a local $fn on 90-96% of its round primitives on a
 * graduated 6/8/12/16/24/32/48/64 ladder, so the global rarely applied.
 *

 * on an unrequested behaviour that one model family has and another does not.
 *
 * `$fn = 0` restores OpenSCAD's own size-adaptive rule —
 * `fragments = min(360/$fa, r*2*PI/$fs)`, floor 5 — so a bolt head gets few
 * facets and a wheel gets many, with no cooperation from the model. Measured on
 * the same two drafts:

 *
 * It corrects the model that does not self-manage and barely touches the one
 * that does, because a local `$fn` still wins where a module sets one
 * deliberately. AO renders of the gpt model at both settings are visually
 * indistinguishable.
