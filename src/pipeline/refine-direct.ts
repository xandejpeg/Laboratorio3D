/**
 * Direct refine — the same context → critic → fix cycle, run as a pipeline
 * instead of as an agent.
 *
 * ## Why this replaces the agent loop
 *
 * The agent version gave the model seventeen tools and asked it to sequence
 * them itself: render, then diagnose, then measure, then pick one of six edit
 * tools, then compile, then render again, then accept or revert. Measured on a
 * 19-part assault buggy, one run spent **53 tool calls to land 3 accepted
 * edits**. Twenty-five of those calls were `read_scad` — the model paging the
 * source back in a module at a time, because we never gave it the file, while
 * the draft stage next door puts the whole buffer in every prompt. Two of six
 * cycles ended in a revert having produced nothing at all.
 *
 * None of those seven steps is a decision. The order never varies, and every
 * deviation from it was a bug we then wrote scaffolding to contain: a nudge for
 * when the model stopped early, a call cap for when nudging blew the context
 * window, a transaction log for when it forgot to accept, a facet-ratio rescue
 * for when `edit_full` silently re-authored the model at 1/30 the detail.
 *
 * So the sequence is code now, and the model does the two things that actually
 * need judgement: **what is wrong** (critic) and **what the corrected code is**
 * (patch). Two LLM calls per cycle, no tools, no transcript growth across
 * cycles — each patch call is fresh, so a long refine can't blow the window.
 *
 * ## The cycle
 *
 *   compile → render 7 views → measure connectivity
 *          → CRITIC  (vision call → prioritised issue list)
 *          → measure the flagged modules (world bboxes + pairwise gaps)
 *          → PATCH   (one call → new module bodies / placements)
 *          → apply → compile → regression gates → keep or revert
 *
 * Reverting is a plain assignment here: the buffer is a string, the previous
 * value is the previous string. That is the whole of what `edit-transaction.ts`,
 * `accept_edit` and `revert_edit` were for.
