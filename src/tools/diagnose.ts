/**
 * diagnose tool — the CRITIC step of the context → critic → fix cycle.
 *
 * This is a SEPARATE vision LLM call (not the agent's own turn): it loads the
 * dedicated reviewer prompt (src/pipeline/diagnose-prompt.md), shows the
 * reference image + the current-build views cached by the last render_views
 * call + the current SCAD + prior-iteration history, and returns a structured
 * `SUMMARY: … / ISSUES: [SEV] [modules: …] → FIX: …` diagnosis. It writes no
 * code — the agent (the fixer) applies the diagnosis with edit_module/edit_full.
 *
 * A separate vision call, not a tool the agent answers itself. Per cycle it saves, into
 * `_refine_steps/step_NNN/`:
 *   diagnosis.txt           — the structured diagnosis (what the agent acts on)
 *   diagnose_response.txt    — the critic's full raw response
 *   diagnose_thinking.txt    — the critic's reasoning (when the model emits any)
 *
 * The diagnosis is also appended to state.diagnosisHistory so the next cycle's
 * critic sees what was previously flagged and focuses on what's still wrong.
